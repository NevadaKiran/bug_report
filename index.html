        <h2> A WEBSITE FAILURE</h2>
        <p>Much time and effort not understanding why my intended website kept turning up blank pages,
          both on 'namecheap' and on Github, was an issue of much consternation, until a fellow
          classmate enlightened me.</p>
          <p>And the answer is that if the name of the 'html' file is not "index" the servers, or whatever
            have a hard time reading it.  This also answered another question that confounded me: "Why does
            everyone unimaginatively lable their files "index""</p>
            <p>Next question to be answered: 'What is with the constant use of "Hello World"?' </p>

        <p>It is midnight, I need to get into this later.  But this too was a journey</p>

        <p>Just basic pics of bugs thus far, and not really sure this format will work for the bug report,
          but the idea has kept me up. It is near midnight thirty, and I have to wake up at 6 ish.  More on this later</p>
