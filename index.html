        <h2> A WEBSITE FAILURE</h2>
        <p>Much time and effort not understanding why my intended website kept turning up blank pages,
          both on 'namecheap' and on Github, was an issue of much consternation, until a fellow
          classmate enlightened me.</p>
          <p>And the answer is that if the name of the 'html' file is not "index" the servers, or whatever
            have a hard time reading it.  This also answered another question that confounded me: "Why does
            everyone unimaginatively lable their files "index""</p>
            <p>Next question to be answered: 'What is with the constant use of "Hello World"?' </p>

        <h2>GIT STATUS FAIL</h2>
        <p>It is midnight, I need to get into this later.  But this too was a journey</p>
        </div>
        <div class="extras">
        <p>No pictures of bugs yet, and not really sure this format will work for the bug report,
          but the idea has kept me up. It is near midnight thirty, and I have to wake up at 6 ish.  More on this later</p>
